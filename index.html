  <p>A computer scientist and mathematician, Margaret Hamilton got humans to the moon with her code as Project Apollo's lead software engineer. Her work prevented an abort of the Apollo 11 moon landing. She’s also credited for coining the term “software
    engineer.”
  </p>
  <p>Given the scarcity of women in technology back then (and at present), Hamilton and her work truly changed notions of what humanity could achieve, especially for women. Women at the time were "mere programmers" who operated punchcard machines, though
    often times they had to devise creative solutions themselves.</p>
  <p>Hamilton proved programming to be more than just simple typing. A true pioneer in software, her code was deployed in the Apollo missions—the first time software had ever been entrusted in a lunar landing. And thanks to her rigorous coding practices
    (e.g. protecting against buffer overflows and cycle-stealing), that mission-critical task was a success.</p>
  <blockquote id="quote">I remember thinking, Oh my God, it worked. I was so happy. But I was more happy about it working than about the fact that we landed.</blockquote>
  <p>Now CEO of her own company, Hamilton Technologies, and winner of the '86 Lovelace Award, Hamilton continues to serve as a role model, especially for aspiring girls and women in tech. Though she was too immersed in her work to focus much on the gender
    issues of the time, she nonetheless was aware of unfair policies. In a recent interview on Medium, she expresses her frustration that women were often relegated to lower positions in the computer science field and paid lower salaries than men.</p>
